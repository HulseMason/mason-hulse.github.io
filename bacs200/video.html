                          Feeding America believes that only by understanding it can we truly find solutions to hunger in America. This belief leads us to invest in top-of-the-line research initiatives â€“ such as the annual Map the Meal Gap report and our quadrennial Hunger in America (HIA) Study. Map the Meal Gap provides food insecurity rates for every county and congressional district in America.

                          We advocate for programs that protect people facing hunger through a policy staff based in Washington, DC and through our Hunger Action Center, a massive grassroots advocacy center based online. The Hunger Action Center consists of an online community of more than 150,000 people who help us champion hunger-relief programs at the federal, state and local levels.
